The long and intimate, though by no means friendly, relation which unhappily subsisted between you and myself, leads me to hope that you will easily account for the great liberty which I now take inaddressing you in this open and public manner.  The same fact maypossibly remove any disagreeable surprise which you may experience onagain finding your name coupled with mine, in any other way than in an advertisement, accurately describing my person, and offering a large sum for my arrest.  In thus dragging you again before the public, I am aware that I shall subject myself to no inconsiderable amount of censure.


I shall probably be charged with an unwarrantable if not a
wanton and reckless disregard of the rights and proprieties of private
life.  There are those North as well as South, who entertain a much
higher respect for rights which are merely conventional, than they do
for rights which are personal and essential.  Not a few there are in
our country who, while they have no scruples against robbing the
laborer of the hard earned results of his patient industry, will be
shocked by the extremely indelicate manner of bringing your name
before the public.
