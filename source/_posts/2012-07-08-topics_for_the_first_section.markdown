These are the topics I'm planning to cover in the first *section*. I'm posting this up to solicit feedback on content as well as order

  1. Registers and bookmarks
  1. A bunch of minor modes (auto-fill, flyspell etc.)
  1. Basic customisation (probably a multi part episode)
     - Very basic elisp.
     - Simple settings like colours, font size etc.
     - Minor modes
     - Mode hooks
     - Key bindings
     - The `customize` system
     - Organising your `.emacs` file.
  1. Keyboard macros

I think this should cover it. I might make changes based on how the episodes turn out but this sounds like a decent starting point. 

The other three sections will cover applications like `dired` etc., programming modes and utilities and finally, elisp. I'll worry about those when I get there.

This is a call for feedback so please let me know.
