title: "The region"

This post discusses the `region`, the `point`, the `mark` and related matters. It generally deals with the business of cutting and pasting within Emacs. It's a little longer than the others and a little less structured but I think the future screencasts are going to be that way anyway.

The video sizes are unnaturally huge this time. I'll probably scale them down from now.

The H.264 version of the video for iOS devices is at <http://archive.org/download/EmacsMovies/episode-region.mkv>.

Comments and feedback are, as always, welcome.
